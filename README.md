# sunriseKernel
An incomplete kernel from my pursuit of the Udemy course [Developing a Multithreaded Kernel from Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/developing-a-multithreaded-kernel-from-scratch/). Still under progress whenever I've got time from uni.

## Usage
I got this to work on one computer but it won't run on two others... I guess one thing I've learnt is the tedium of dealing with the border between hardware and software. 'Nuff said. Still under progress.

## Purpose
I started getting interested in computing with low-level stuff, and this (along with MIT OCW 6.004) was the logical continuation of that. I was really satisfied with knowledge about the overview of how a computer works from transistor to beginning the OS (6.004), and am continuing that with details of the OS itself here.
